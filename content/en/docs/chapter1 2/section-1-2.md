The format of OSCs that we introduce in this Starter Kit is a **bottom-up** learning community comprising members of various scientific disciplines and career stages. The main target audience of OSCs are academics, but others, e.g. from industry, ministries or citizens, are also welcome to join.

Our vision and mission are:

> **Vision and Mission**
> 
> Open Science improves the quality, accessibility, and efficiency of science, but is **not yet the norm** in research. While pioneering scholars are developing and embracing Open Science practices, the majority sticks to the *status quo*. To *move from pioneers to common practice*, we need to engage a critical proportion of the research community.
> 
> This is where Open Science Communities come into play. 
> 
> Open Science Communities provide a place where **newcomers and experienced peers** interact, **inspire each other** to embed Open Science practices and values in their workflows, and provide feedback on policies, infrastructure, and support services.
> 
> Together, we make Open Science the norm!  

The above mission can be broken down into practical aims (*Figure 3*):

> **Aims**
> - Invite newcomers to Open Science
> - Increase engagement in Open Science practices 
> - Serve as a breeding ground for Open Science initiatives 
> - Interact with policy, infrastructure and support services
> - Foster interactions between academia and society

*Aim #1 - Invite newcomers to Open Science*   
The core aim of an OSC is to welcome newcomers to OS and to provide a platform where they can learn from their peers and identify ways to overcome bottlenecks when transitioning to (more) open workflows. An OSC is a learning community: you do not need to have any experience with OS to join the community, or commit to such practices upon joining. What unites community members is their interest in OS, publicly displayed on the website of their OSC.   
To interact with newcomers, it is crucial for them to know of the existence of your community. You need to be visible. Also, newcomers need to be attracted to the community. They need to feel at home. It is key here to strike the right tone. We provide practical guidelines in these regards in [*Section II*]({{< ref "../chapter2/_index.md" >}}).

*Aim #2 -  Increase engagement with Open Science practices*   
Increasing engagement with OS practices is central to our mission. This includes inspiring newcomers to take their first steps, but also consolidating current OS practices amongst colleagues that already opened (parts of) their workflow. Our main strategy is to facilitate knowledge exchange amongst peers. In [*Section II*]({{< ref "../chapter2/_index.md" >}}), we provide several practical examples of formats that promote knowledge exchange amongst peers.

*Aim #3: Serve as a breeding ground for Open Science initiatives*   
The success of a community depends on the contributions of its members. It is therefore important to **enable members to start their own initiatives** within the community. These member initiatives can be facilitated by providing guidelines, announcing them on the website, newsletter, and social media, and, if possible, allocating budget. Instead of developing new initiatives, members can also adopt existing formats that were proven successful in other institutions (e.g., other OSCs). Practical guidelines and examples of existing successful formats are detailed in [*Section II*]({{< ref "../chapter2/_index.md" >}}).

*Aim #4: Interact with policy, infrastructure and support services*   
One of the key features of an OSC is that it operates **independently** from institutional policy. That means that the community is a self-steering organisation that does not receive instructions, targets, or tasks from other parties. However, OSCs should not operate in isolation. As discussed in [*Section I.I*]({{< ref "../chapter1/section-1-1.md" >}}), OSCs are well placed between policy and infrastructure. Policy describes what is required, desired, and incentivised; infrastructure determines what is possible; but the community determines how things are done in practice. To facilitate a smooth transition to OS, all stakeholders need to collaborate. Therefore, community coordinator(s) strive to increase connections with colleagues at leadership positions, in particular those involved in **institutional policies, infrastructure, and support**. Practical examples of collaborations with such stakeholders are discussed in [*Section II*]({{< ref "../chapter2/_index.md" >}}).

*Aim #5: Foster interactions between academia and society*   
OS means not only open to colleagues in academia, but also open to society. We therefore foster interactions between academics and societal stakeholders, such as civil societies, civilians, patients, politicians, and industry. A first step is to make our work accessible to these stakeholders. Where applicable, we also encourage engaging with these stakeholders in all stages of the research cycle.
