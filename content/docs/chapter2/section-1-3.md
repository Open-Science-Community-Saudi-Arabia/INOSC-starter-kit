To get a taste of how an OSC can evolve, letâ€™s have a look at how the OSCs in the Netherlands have advanced. The first OSC was the one in Utrecht ([OSCU](https://openscience-utrecht.com/)), started in 2018 at Utrecht University by two researchers with a passion for OS. They started out by making the prevalence of OS practices at their university more visible, by asking colleagues that were engaged in OS to join the community and listing their OS expertise on the community website. In addition, they recruited members that were interested in OS, but did not have prior experience with it. These members could then contact their more experienced peers to learn more about certain OS practices. Moreover, OSCU members received a monthly newsletter and the founders started to showcase the community around campus and on social media. Over time, the number of members increased and OSCU started organizing a series of workshops whose topics were based on a survey amongst its members. In addition, the founders created a [step-by-step tutorial](https://openscience-utrecht.com/community-blueprint/) describing how they started OSCU, to help colleagues at other universities start a similar initiative at their university. Within a year, colleagues from several Dutch universities (*Figure 3*) started parallel OSCs, operating under a similar acronym and logo and sharing a set of Guiding Principles and a Code of Conduct.[^1]   
After a year, OSCU secured a budget from Utrecht University to further develop and sustain its activities, which led to the appointment of Faculty Ambassadors to promote the community in their respective faculties via OSC-NL (OSC Netherlands) meetings. After the first OSC-NL meeting, a plethora of OS workshops and events were organized far beyond Utrecht. For example, in the first year after attending the first OSC-NL, the Open Science Community Groningen (OSCG) held a petition in which 244 staff members of the University of Groningen indicated they would be willing to actively support the OSCG. After their official kick-off, the OSCG organized six lectures and workshops (e.g., on data visualization, registered reports, and preregistration for qualitative studies), launched a [website](https://openscience-groningen.nl/), a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/OSCGroningen) (420 followers and counting), and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNqQuXVcwnnof_7QEIaabdQ), and started to send out a bi-monthly OSCG newsletter (227 subscribers). Most recently, in collaboration with the University Library, they set up an annual [Open Research Award](https://openscience-groningen.nl/call-for-submissions-open-research-awards/) for university staff and students.   
In less than two years, eleven OSCs sprouted in the Netherlands and two outside of the Netherlands (*Figure 4*), who all organized different OS activities and sought where they could contribute the most within that specific university (see *Box 1* for an overview of achievements). While this organic approach was fast, fun, and effective in the short run, it lacked a clear overarching goal or strategy. Decisions were typically made *ad-hoc* (should we organise another workshop? Or start a blog? Or... Or... ) and it was difficult to assess how successful our communities were in practice. Therefore, we decided to take a step back and reflect on our goals, strategies, and tools, which we now articulate in this Starter Kit.[^2]


> **Box 1.** Achievements of OSCs since 2018.
> - OSCs at eleven[^3] Dutch Universities, totalling more than 700 members (and growing!)
> - Two OSCs outside of the Netherlands, in Sweden and Ireland
> - Many OS workshops and events, with up to 75 attendees
> - Several OS blogs written on various Open Science related topics (e.g., [10 Open Science Myths](https://openscience-groningen.nl/10-open-science-myths/))
> - OSCG launched annual [Open Research Award](https://openscience-groningen.nl/call-for-submissions-open-research-awards/)
> - Frequent requests to provide OS lectures and workshops at national and international events
> - Contributed to large EU and USA funding proposals
> - Frequent requests to advise local policy makers
> - Frequent request to promote materials (e.g., for University Libraries, or the national ORCID project)
> - Received recognition locally from [Rectors](https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/uu-oaj-2019-2020-henk-kummeling.pdf) and Deans and internationally from the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/blog/how-build-open-science-network-your-community) and the [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/mission/awards/)

[^1]: It is interesting to note that, while OSCs are open to members of all disciplines, the founders of these communities are often researchers in the field of Social Sciences. This is likely because the discourse around OS is very lively in this discipline, but also because most OSC coordinators attend the same events. One of the most influential in this respect is the annual meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Sciences ([SIPS](http://improvingpsych.org/)), where the format of the OSC was actively promoted by the OSCU founders.
